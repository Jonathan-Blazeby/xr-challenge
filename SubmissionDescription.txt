Features Implemented:
	Player:
		Movement left, right, forward, backward with WASD
		Jumping with Space bar
		3D humanoid model
		Animation for both idle and movement (except jumping)
	Camera:
		Moves with player
		Audio Listener set to player position but camera direction for proper effect
	Pickups:
		Pickup 'picked up' when player collides with it, as using the given (unchanged) Pickup script
		Score UI changes when pickup 'picked up'
		Audio played upon pickup
	GUI:
		Score UI changes when pickups are 'picked up'
		Player Healthbar added
		Text will appear in centre of screen to display relevant messages such as "You Died", etc.
	Hazards/Enemies:
		PlayerHealth in General:
			Player starts with 100% health
			When damage taken 'pain' audio is played
			Damage can only be taken every one second
		Lava Pool:
			Player takes 20% damage every 1 second they are in there
			Audio played upon entering
		Turrets:
			When player enters detection range, top of turrets begin to rotate toward player and start firing bullets
			Player takes 10% damage when hit by bullet (though not more than once in a 1 second instance)
			Line renderer appears to better show turret direction and detection range
 			Audio played when each bullet is fired
	Game-Loop:
		Player starts in level with max health and zero score
		When player has collected all the pickups, a message is displayed directing them to the endzone
		If endzone touched victory message is played and level resets (alt message plays and no reset if endzone touched before all pickups collected)
		If player health reaches zero, no more damage taken, Death message appears, level resets 
	Environment:
		Lunar crater terrain with texture, normal, and height maps
		New Skybox added
		Stairs used to demonstrate that the player can walk easily up steps, platforms added to demonstrate jumping
		Translucent boundary walls restrict player to level (though without them, if player falls off level they die and level resets)
		Particle effects on lava and rocket

Proposed Improvements:
	Either proper Camera controls, or committing to the fixed isometric view in all aspects of gameplay
	More levels beyond the testing sandbox I put together
	Enemies beyond just the turrets (ones that move and have more complex AI)
	Proper Jumping animation for the player
	Rocketship would blast off in little cutscene when you win
	More detailed player model/texture (likely an astronaut to fit with rest of game) 

Comments/Thoughts:
	A very fun challenge with a lot of room for experimentation, though in some ways perhaps a bit too open ended. If some people had the time available to spend every waking hour of the full week on this, they could produce a full games worth of content, which may show them in better light than somebody who has other work commitments during that time.
